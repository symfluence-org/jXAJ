"""Tests that the differentiable loss scores only the calibration window.

The JAX losses used to slice off warmup and then score everything that
remained. With a calibration/evaluation split configured that span covers
both windows, so gradient-based optimizers were trained on the held-out
evaluation period and reported a score computed over a different window
than the Calib_* metrics written at final evaluation.

``cal_slice`` narrows the loss to the calibration period. These tests pin
that it is honoured: a slice covering the whole post-warmup record must be
a no-op, and a narrower slice must actually change the score.
